# Practice test for Federico Corradi @Tangent

I wanna start by saying thank you to Anders for giving me the chance to introduce my self the other day. I've to admit that some of the things that where part of this test I had very little knowledge about, but as everything I ever did in this indutsry, I tried to make it a learning experience. I think I have satisfied the great majority of the tasks, but I had to leave one in particular out, the testing one.
As metioned already to Anders, I had some experience with it but very little. After this test, it will surely become one of the things at the top of my list to learn more about.

The main reason for leaving it out, is time. I had not enough time to reaserch and learn how to implement it, so I rathered focused on the core aspects of the tasks.

## About this task
- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
- Just simply run 'yarn install' and 'yarn start'
- The app is made of 3 pages, 'Home', 'Your list', 'Movie'
- Every movie card is clickable and it get into more details about the movie
- The API is a GraphQL [node application I made for this test](https://github.com/fredcorr/omdb_graphql).
- I used Redux to create the 'Your List' page where you can see the movie you have selected
- I wrote little media queries because I took advantage of FlexBox and Grid

## Third Party Packages
- I used react-icons to include SVG icons, I find an excelent way to include SVG given the variety it offers and how quick they are to implement
- I used Apollo-client to query GraphQL, it's one of the most recommened on the market and it's really easy to use with queries
- I used framer-motion for the page transtions and small animation, I find very easy to use when it comes to Animate Presence,as the initial, animate and exit values are very clear.

I hope eveything makes sense.
if you have any questions please don't hesistate to ask
